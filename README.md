## Week 1
### Introduction
- Supervised Learning
  - Regression -> Predict continuous output
    - Example: Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict the price.
  - Classification -> Discrete value of output
    - Example: Given a patient with a tumor, predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign

- Unsupervised Learning
  - Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.
  - We can derive structure from data where we don't know necessarily know the effect of the variables. 
  - Clustering
